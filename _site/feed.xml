        <title>IgniteSTEM 2018 Teacher Award</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;IgniteSTEM is pleased to present our 2018 Teacher Award to Kevin Ruane of Ocean Township Elementary School.  Kevin was driving force in starting the maker movement in the elementary school, and started a maker space club at Ocean township Elementary School in 2015-2016 that has now grown to all three elementary schools in the district. Kevin has been part of the IgniteSTEM community since 2016, attending all threy flagship conferences, and has used what he has learned at the conference to ignite the flame of design thinking not only at the maker space club, but also in the classroom as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin also uses the 20 percent time or genius hour in his everyday curriculum that stimulates students learn about their passions, and has been instrumental in the elementary Science curriculum rewrite to be inline with the  NGSS. His next goal is to start an elementary hackathon in his district, and plans to use the funds of this award to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
